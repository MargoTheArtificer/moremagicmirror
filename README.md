# moremagicmirror
This is to record my changes to personalize my MagicMirror.
I already made a MagicMirror and I'm still futzing with it. 
I find that when I look up stuff online, there's a lot of expectation that you already know how to navigate command prompt and ssh. 
I hope to explain in laymans terms the best I can.
As always, do refer to https://magicmirror.builders/ for in depth info. I'm no expert.
